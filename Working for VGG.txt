Initial Code :

Both the basic NN and Deep Learning had code for binary accuracy every where. 

Updated Code:

No change in the NN code, but new train_generator, test_generator, validation_generator is created with categorical as accuracy parameter and binary_
accuracy was changed to categorical accuracy wherever needed. 

This is what was there in lab 10 code as well. In lab's initial code block, he asked to uncomment few lines if we were performing binary image 
classification but rest of the codes were same as muliclass classification problem. So I did as per the lab code and used categorical everywhere for 
CNN.

Optimized CNN is still overfitting, you need to do more of optimization, which is mentioned at the optimization part in lab's code.

Hope things are clear!!!
